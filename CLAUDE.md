- ✅ **Weight timing:** Manual weight entry tied to sessions with set number association and edit capabilities
- ✅ **System complexity:** Modular architecture with clear separation between perception, server, and mobile

### Ongoing Considerations

- 🚧 **Identity reliability:** Conservative face recognition thresholds planned (>0.85) with manual override options
- 📝 **Camera positioning:** Guidance needed for optimal placement to minimize self-occlusion
- 📝 **Multi-person conflicts:** Current tracking handles overlapping bounding boxes, but pose mixing still possible
- 📝 **Real-time performance:** Monitor frame processing latency under increased load

### POC Scope Management

- ✅ **Exercise catalog:** Limited to 2 exercises with configurable angle thresholds
- ✅ **Event semantics:** Clear event types with structured metadata and confidence scoring
- ✅ **Data evolution:** Schema versioning ready for adding new exercise types and event structures

## Evolution Path (Post-POC)

- **Multi-camera:** Calibration, cross-camera handoff, floor-plane mapping, and multi-target multi-camera tracking; preserve event contracts.
- **Sensors:** Integrate BLE or load-cell inputs for weight ground truth; reconcile multiple sources using confidence and priority rules.
- **Scale & deploy:** Move perception to edge nodes; host the server in a managed environment; implement comprehensive authentication/authorization, rate limits, and observability.
- **Analytics:** Build roll-ups for session summaries, personal records, and trends; add coach/admin dashboards.
