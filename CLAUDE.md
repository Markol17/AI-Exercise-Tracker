- **Computer Vision:** YOLOv8n (ultralytics) + MediaPipe for pose estimation
- **Dependencies:** torch>=2.0.0, opencv, face-recognition, dlib, scipy
- **Configuration:** Environment variables for camera index, frame rate, confidence thresholds
- **Models:** YOLOv8n.pt for person detection, MediaPipe for 17-point pose estimation

### Server (TypeScript + Node.js)

- **Framework:** Express.js with oRPC integration and OpenAPI documentation
- **Database:** Drizzle ORM with Postgres 16-alpine via Docker Compose
- **Real-time:** WebSocket server with session-scoped event broadcasting
- **Validation:** Zod schemas for all API contracts with type safety
- **Environment:** Configurable via .env files for database, authentication, and ports

### Mobile (React Native/Expo)

- **Framework:** Expo with TypeScript and file-based routing
- **State:** React Query for server state, local useState for UI state
- **Navigation:** Expo Router with tab-based navigation structure
- **API Client:** Generated from shared oRPC contracts with full type safety
- **Real-time:** WebSocket integration for live session updates

### Shared Packages (TypeScript Monorepo) [[memory:6541546]]

- **@vero/db:** Drizzle schema, migrations, and database configuration
- **@vero/auth:** Authentication types and utilities (prepared for expansion)
- **Workspace management:** npm workspaces with build orchestration scripts

## Risk Mitigation & Current Status

### Addressed Risks

- **Occlusion handling:** MediaPipe confidence thresholds (>0.5) filter unreliable joint detections
- **Exercise limitations:** Started with 2 clear exercises (squats, bicep curls) with distinct joint movements
- **Weight timing:** Manual weight entry tied to sessions with set number association and edit capabilities
- **System complexity:** Modular architecture with clear separation between perception, server, and mobile

### Ongoing Considerations

- **Identity reliability:** Conservative face recognition thresholds planned (>0.85) with manual override options
- **Camera positioning:** Guidance needed for optimal placement to minimize self-occlusion
- **Multi-person conflicts:** Current tracking handles overlapping bounding boxes, but pose mixing still possible
- **Real-time performance:** Monitor frame processing latency under increased load

### POC Scope Management

- **Exercise catalog:** Limited to 5 exercises (squats, pushups, lunges, plank, shoulder taps) with configurable angle thresholds
- **Event semantics:** Clear event types with structured metadata and confidence scoring
- **Data evolution:** Schema versioning ready for adding new exercise types and event structures

## Evolution Path (Post-POC)

- **Multi-camera:** Calibration, cross-camera handoff, floor-plane mapping, and multi-target multi-camera tracking; preserve event contracts.
- **Sensors:** Integrate BLE or load-cell inputs for weight ground truth; reconcile multiple sources using confidence and priority rules.
- **Scale & deploy:** Move perception to edge nodes; host the server in a managed environment; implement comprehensive authentication/authorization, rate limits, and observability.
- **Analytics:** Build roll-ups for session summaries, personal records, and trends; add coach/admin dashboards.
